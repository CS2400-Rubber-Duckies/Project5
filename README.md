# CS2400 - Project 5

Rubber Duckies: Gelila Chaka and UyenNghi Nguyen

- Gelila worked on the depth-first traversal.
- UyenNghi worked on breadth-first traversal.
- We worked together on debugging and improving our algorithms.
- To run our code, run the Main class. The integer values of each letter are as follows: A = 0, B = 1, C = 2, D = 3, E = 4, F = 5, G = 6, H = 7, I = 8.

Additional Features:

- Java interface and generic data types
- Adjacency List
- Screencast
